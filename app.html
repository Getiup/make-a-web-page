		  	<h3 id="Systematic">Systematic Debugging:</h3>
		  	Systems thinking happens when 
		    you break a big problem down into smaller pieces. Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it. If this is unclear now, don't worry! You'll understand what this means much more clearly by the end of the Nanodegree.<p><strong>Problem</strong>= Find the problem.</p><strong>Possible Causes</strong>= Investigate critical thinking.
		    <h3 id="Technological">Technological Emphaty:</h3>
		    "Technological empathy" comes in  many forms. For example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what it's good and bad at doing. Understanding how computers see things.

    		HTML and CSS are both "languages" HTML controls the "structure" of a web page CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks). When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.

			Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.[11] Inheritance relies on
      		the document tree, which is the hierarchy of (X)HTML elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties,
      		but box-related properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.<p>Inheritance prevents certain properties from being declared over and over again in a style sheet, allowing the software developers to write less CSS. It enhances faster-loading of web pages by users and enables the clients to save money on bandwidthand development costs.</p>You can also think about CSS as a search and replace tool: you identify a class or a tag of the element you want to find (or match, in CSS terminology), and then what you want to do with it, or what property values to replace with different ones.

			<h3 id="Order">Order Matters</h3>
			It also matters where you define the rules and in what order they are applied. Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order, with definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions:<p>The default style of a browser (different browsers have slightly different styles)</p>Stylesheet in a separate file (this is what you will be mostly using)<p>Stylesheet inside HTML (this can be done for small projects but is not ideal)</p>Inline style in an element (this can also be done but should be avoided)
			<h3 id="Specifics">Specifics Matter</h3>
			"Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.
